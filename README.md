# Learning-HTML-CSS

 This repository is used to document my journey of learning HTML & CSS. 
- I will be starting this journey on the `22th September 2022`.
- The reason for documenting the journey is to help others so that they can take something from it and can contribute to enhance the resources. 

- Goal
    - 1-2 hour/day 
    
=> Going ahead with 
 -  SuperSimpleDev HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2022) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=9430s)
